# Tools for Open Science: Git

This week, [Heath Blackmon](http://coleoguy.github.io), [Emma Goldberg](http://eeg.github.io/lab/home.html#welcome) and [Dudu Meireles](http://www.bradpittweb.com) will give you a head start on how to use the version control system [git](https://git-scm.com).

The class will be basically a computer lab, so it is very important that you do two things **before** class (and that may take more than 5 minutes)

1. Have [git](https://git-scm.com) installed on your machine
2. Get a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

Email Dudu at <meireles@umn.edu> if you have any questions / issues.

## 1. Install git <small>(before class, really)</small>

Things are a bit different for Linux, OSX and for Windows. Here is how to do it.

### Linux
I guess that people using Linux can figure out their way. You may already have git, so try `git --version` first. Installing it should be as simple as `sudo apt-get install git-all` (Debian based). Check [this page](http://git-scm.com/download/linux) for more options.


### OSX
Like in Linux, you may already have git installed. Check it by typing `git --version` in the terminal. If you don't already have it, you can try the official binary [installer](http://git-scm.com/download/mac) or get it via [homebrew](http://brew.sh).


### Windows
You can download git from [here](https://git-for-windows.github.io) and follow the instructions of the installer.

After the installation wizard is done, open the __gitBASH__ program, which emulates a *nix style command line, and type `git --version`. You should see something like `git version 2.6.3`. 

Although not really required, a text editor like [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org) can come in handy.

## 2. Get a GitHub account

First, __do not install the GitHub Desktop app__. It may have a cute octocat icon, but **1)** you're not a 5 year old and **2)** it hides some important stuff.

Anyways, there's no mystery here. If you already have an account, make sure that you know your username / passoword and that you can log in smoothly.

If you don't already have an account, just go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create one.
